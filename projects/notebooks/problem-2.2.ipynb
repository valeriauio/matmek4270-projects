    "\n",
    "This exercise asks you to solve the ODE $u'=-au$ with $a < 0$ such that\n",
    "the ODE models exponential growth instead of exponential decay.  A\n",
    "central theme is to investigate numerical artifacts and non-physical\n",
    "solution behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Set $a=-1$ and run experiments with $\\theta=0, 0.5, 1$ for various values of $\\Delta t$ to uncover numerical artifacts. Recall that the exact solution is a monotone, growing function when $a < 0$. Oscillations or significantly wrong growth are signs of wrong qualitative behavior.\n",

    "From the experiments, select four values of $\\Delta t$ that\n",
    "demonstrate the kind of numerical solutions that are characteristic\n",
    "for this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Write up the amplification factor and plot it for $\\theta=0,0.5,1$ together with the exact one for $a\\Delta t < 0$. Use the plot to explain the observations made in the experiments.\n",
